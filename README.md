# jbook-deploy

## JBook
Jbook is a code ediiting and a code documenting app. In the app, the user can code a react js application, just like they would in lets say VScode. The user has the ability to import libraries, such as Redux, styled components, etc. just like in any small to large scale react app. Consider the app as a code pen clone, but with the added functionality of documenting the code you have written (with the option of a markdown editor). Once the user has finished working, they can store save their work in a file inside the user's hard drive.

## Features
- The user can write and execute react applications in the browser.
- The user can import as many CSS or React libraries as they want in their application.
- The user can see the output of their code in real time on the output window that's attached to the code cell (they are cells in which user writes their code).
- The user can document the their code (for eg: To explain how the code that they have written runs, and/or th purpose of their code).
- The user can add as many code cells and text cells(they are cells in which user can give some documentation or explaination for their code) as they want.
- The user can delete their code cells and text cells.
- The user can move their code or text cells with the help of arrow buttons.
